              <p id = "txt_01" class = "text">If transport to hospital is not immediately required, clinicians will consider if alternative care pathways, or GP triage, are appropriate options for an individual with dementia. However, there will always be some situations where going in to hospital is necessary. PTS staff may need to give additional support to a person with dementia, especially if they are travelling without an escort, as unfamiliar environments can cause anxiety. </p>
