For example, pointing to the patient's arm or gently touching their wrist to see if there is a reaction. Alternatively, the Wong-Baker Pain Scale is a good example of using point to assess pain when the patient cannot verbally communicate this. ",

Examples of this are: grimacing facial expressions, moaning with movement and distressing changes in behaviour. The Abbey Pain Scale and for advanced dementia - the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD) are good examples of a tools to use to assess non-verbal patients."
